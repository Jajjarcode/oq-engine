# Input file for ERF logic tree definition. 
    
# A logic tree is defined by a series of branching levels (each identified by the keyword "BranchingLevel"). 
# Each branching level is defined by:
# - a integer number: (identifying the position of the level in the logic tree)
# - a string: (describing what type of epistemic uncertainties the branching level is representing),
# - a string: indicating to which previously defined branches, the current branching level applies to.
# currently only two strings are supported: "NONE", "ALL". The string "NONE" represents the case in which
# the branching level does not apply to anything (this is only used for the first branching level), 
# and the string "ALL" indicating that the branching level applies to all previously created branches 
# NOTE: in the future we want to implement branching levels that can apply to specific branches (and not all),
# in this case the user will introduce, rather than a string, one or more integers referring to indexes of
# previously defined branches to which the current branching level is applying to. However this feature is
# not currently supported.

# A branching level is then populated by one or more branches. A set of branches is defined by the keyword
# "BranchSet".
# A "BranchSet" is defined by an uncertainty model descriptor (specifying how the uncertainty model is defined). Currently
# there are two ways to specify an uncertainty model:
#         - inputfile: ASCII input file defining a source model
#         - rule: predefined string defining a single parameter uncertainty model
# If "inputfile" is chosen then the user must provide one or more input file names (including paths)
# together with descriptor strings and associated weights.
# If "rule" is chosen then the user must provide a rule descriptor string (among the ones that the software can process)
# and one or more parameter uncertainties values, together with the associated weights.
# NOTE: the only rules implemented so far are:
# - mMaxGRRelative: relative uncertainties on maximum magnitude for GR mfd (uncertainties are applied conserving total moment rate)
# - bGRRelative: relative uncertainties on GR b value (uncertainties are applied conserving total moment rate)

# keyword "BranchingLevel" define beginning of branching level definition
BranchingLevel
# branching level number (it's the first so equal to 1)
1
# branching label (a string describing what type of uncertainties this branching level is representing)
source geometry uncertainties
# to which previously defined branches it applies (NONE because it's the first branching level)
NONE

# keyword "BranchSet" define beginning of branches definition
# In this case two source models are given
BranchSet
# uncertainty model type
inputfile
# input file name(s)
nshmp-california-faults.dat
# input file descriptor(s) (in each descriptor spaces are not allowed)
california_fault_model
# weight(s)
